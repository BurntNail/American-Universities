- 2 ratios involved in the Question.
- Example:
	- Bran's hourly wage is two thirds of Sansa's. Arya's hourly wage to Sansa's hourly wage can be represented as respectively. If Bran earns $10 per hour, then what does Arya earn?
	- id:: 63236454-4a15-42d0-bc31-51dadba6853c
	  $$\frac{Bran}{Sansa} = \frac{2}{3} \quad \frac{5}{4} = \frac{Arya}{Sansa}$$
	- $$\frac{Bran}{Sansa} = \frac{2}{3}x\frac{4}{4} \quad \frac{5}{4}x\frac{3}{3} = \frac{Arya}{Sansa}$$
	- $$\frac{Bran}{Sansa} = \frac{8}{12} \quad \frac{15}{12} = \frac{Arya}{Sansa}$$
	- $$Bran : Arya = 8:15$$
	- id:: 632364e0-4346-4bc8-a593-b6d1283ea561
	  $$Arya = 10 * \frac{8}{15} = \$5.33$$
