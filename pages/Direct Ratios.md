- Often involves:
	- Comparing similar shapes (eg. triangles)
	- Figuring out rates that are directly proportional (eg. Jan mows 7 lawns in 86", how long will it take Jan to mow 16 lawns?)
	- Extrapolating how a sample survey goes.
- Example:
	- A sweet sauce consists of only two ingredients, requiring 2 tablespoons of maple
	  syrup for every 5 tablespoons of honey. If the recipe is set to make 105 ounces of sauce, how
	  many ounces of maple syrup are required?
	- Incorrect:
		- id:: 6323620a-7a61-4b1f-a4dc-871486e3d6cd
		  $$\frac{2\ maple\ syrup}{5\ honey} = \frac{x\ maple\ syrup}{105\ sauce\ mixture}$$
	- Correct:
		- Make sure to use account for all parts.
		- $$\frac{2\ maple\ syrup}{7 sauce\ mixture} = \frac{x\ maple\ syrup}{105\ sauce\ mixture}$$
		- $$(2)(105) = 7x$$
		  $$210 = 7x$$
		  $$x = 30oz$$
